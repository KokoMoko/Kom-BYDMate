/**
 * Pure half of [ClusterMusicBridge]: who owns playback right now, what the card should say, and
 * how the text goes on the wire. JVM-tested; nothing here touches Android.
 *
 * Background: the stock `com.byd.mediacontroller` fills the card (INSTRUMENT_MUSIC_INFO_SET and
 * friends) only for a hard-coded whitelist of Chinese players, BYD's own player and Bluetooth.
 * Any other audio-focus owner gets `sendBlackThirdPartyAppMediaInfo()`: source 26, state 2 and a
 * blank name. Yandex Navigator's in-app music (Alice), Yandex Music, Spotify, internet radio and
 * every other app outside that list leave the card empty while they play, so any of them is a source.
