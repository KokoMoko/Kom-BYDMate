 * would tear the stack down on a single missed read.
 *
 * The factory 360 view owns the screen while it is up (it pops up on its own below 15 km/h and
 * goes away above 30 km/h on some cars), so our windows would only overlap it: they go down for
 * as long as it is in the foreground, and the camera goes cold with them. A warm camera under it
 * kept two previews streaming and the 360 stuttered until BYDMate was killed (tester dump
 * 2026-10-03); once the 360 is gone a held blinker opens the camera again, as after reverse.
 *
 * The camera is wanted only while a single-side turn signal is on at speed: holding it open
 * ahead of time at every speed above the threshold loaded the head unit (a tester's lagged with
 * our camera running alongside other video). Stale telemetry does not cool it — that is the
 * watchdog's job in the controller.
