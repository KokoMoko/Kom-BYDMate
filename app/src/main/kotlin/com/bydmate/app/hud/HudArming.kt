/**
 * The car's own HUD navigation status (HUD wave 1, #198). BYD's instrument draws navigation hints
 * on the glass only while that status is up. OpenBYD raises it with NAVI_STATUS = 2, the HUD
 * layout = 3 and the CAN navi / ISA map statuses = 1, and the firmware lets it drop within a
 * minute or two (#198, Han L: the glass held only while the call repeated every 5 s), so the
 * product re-checks it every [CHECK_PERIOD_MS] while a route is guided.
 *
 * NAVI_STATUS goes out through the SDK call sendAutoNaviStatus inside the daemon first (from the
 * app uid it is a SecurityException); the raw fid write is the fallback when the call is absent,
 * refused, or the daemon is too old to know it, and always while the cluster is fullscreen (rear
 * camera, [CLUSTER] reads 4): on some firmwares the call moves the layout itself. The layout is
 * the one value that stays in the car's settings after the route, so it is read before the first
 * write, kept in [prefs] until it is back (the process dies at ignition off mid-route), and
 * restored by [disarm]. It is never written while the cluster is fullscreen and never when the
 * value found could not be put back. canNavi and isa cannot be read back to an original, so
 * [disarm] sets them to 0 like OpenBYD's stop.
 *
 * One instance per owner: the product runs [start]/[stop], the HUD check drives
 * [arm]/[recheck]/[disarm] itself.
